# PSU Controller (ESP32)

A work-in-progress Power Supply Unit (PSU) controller based on the ESP32 microcontroller using the Arduino framework. This project aims to provide an embedded control system for regulating and monitoring power delivery via a custom-built PSU.

> This project is currently in the **prototyping phase**.
